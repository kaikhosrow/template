			<p> 9/15/2013 </p> Just wanted to write down some thoughts on the first week of classes, I am a transfer student to MSU and this happens to be my first semester of classes. I feel comftorable with all my classes but there is a new atmosphere and structure here at MSU, at my previous institution, Albion College, the classes where much smaller. This is because Albion was tiny compared to MSU. I am used to more communication during and after class. Here it seems as if there is no communication during class and once class is over people put on there headphones and walk out. I hope that in the weeks to come I can meet more people and go to study sessions. Overall i'm very happy with MSU and am excited for the years to come. </p>
			9/18/2013 </p> Today we watched an interesting video, it protrayed a personal story aout a man who was gay. He grew up under tradgic circumstances, at a young age his uncle who was also gay resorted to suicide to escape. He described his disgust with his uncles decision to end his life and explained that now his only example is his Uncle's suicide. The video was very emotional and told the entire story from beginning to end. Though informal it did a great job protraying the emotion and story in ways that I believe a formal story could not.			</p>
